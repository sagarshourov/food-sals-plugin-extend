= Built for WooCommerce =

FooSales POS is designed and built to work natively with WooCommerce. It functions as a WooCommerce point of sale layer, making it possible to process orders in real time while maintaining a centralized architecture. When you process an order through FooSales POS, the order data is sent directly to your WooCommerce store in real time. FooSales leverages the many strengths of WooCommerce which includes secure, regularly audited code and an extensive ecosystem. Furthermore, all your store, customer and order data remain on your web server and is never transmitted or stored on any third-party servers, including our own.

= How do I get started? =

Step 1: Install the WordPress plugin

Install the FooSales POS plugin directly from your WordPress admin area by clicking 'Add New' in the Plugins menu, then search for "FooSales" OR manually [download the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/foosales/) from WordPress.org.

Step 2: Link your store to a 30-day free trial account

[Create a FooSales account](https://www.foosales.com/signup/) which will allow you to access FooSales POS on any computer, iPad or Android tablet.

Step 3: Connect the FooSales POS apps to your store

Download the free FooSales POS [iPad](https://apps.apple.com/app/foosales-for-woocommerce/id1251207715) or [Android tablet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foosales.FooSales) apps or visit [web.foosales.com](https://web.foosales.com) in your web browser and enter your WooCommerce store details to connect securely. FooSales POS can only access a website URL that is linked to your account so it's very important that you enter the correct web address. Installation is quick and easy.

= Support =

[Ask us a question](https://www.foosales.com/support/)

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP version 5.3 or greater (PHP 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater (MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended)
* WooCommerce 3.1.0 

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles all the file transfers. To do an automatic installation of FooSales POS, login to your WordPress admin area, navigate to the Plugins menu and click 'Add New'.

In the search field type "FooSales" and click 'Search Plugins'. Once you've found the FooSales POS plugin, you can view details about it such as release information, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the FooSales POS plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work seamlessly, but as always though, please ensure that you back-up your website just in case.

If for some reason you encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update, you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and clicking 'Save'. That should revert things back to normal.

= How much does FooSales POS cost? =

Various monthly and annual plans are available to suit your needs.

Please see our [Pricing](https://www.foosales.com/pricing/) page for current plans and pricing information.

= Does the FooSales POS plugin work anywhere in the world? =

FooSales POS works in any country that WooCommerce supports which is practically all countries. WooCommerce currently integrates with over 100 different payment gateways.

= Can I process card payments through FooSales POS? =

FooSales POS currently offers a direct integration with Square Terminal (web app only), Square Readers (tablet apps only) and the Square point of sale (Square POS) app to process payments. Square hardware supports EMV chip cards, magnetic stripe cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay and NFC.

Payment type can also be set to Cash, Direct Bank Transfer, Check, Cash on Delivery and Other Payment Method.

Refer to the [WooCommerce Square Payment Integration](https://help.foosales.com/docs/topics/payments/square-payment-integration/) section to learn more. 

= Is FooSales POS just a plugin? =

FooSales POS is an app based WooCommerce POS and is available on iPad, Android tablet and a web app. The apps connect directly to your WooCommerce store using a lightweight WordPress plugin. Our native apps provide various benefits that simply can not be achieved using plugin based POS solutions. These include offline mode, more reliable hardware integration, better printer support, built-in camera support for barcode scanning, and Square payments integration. That said, we also offer a web app so you get the best of both worlds.

= What makes FooSales POS different from other POS systems? =

Most traditional point of sale systems are stand-alone systems and are not designed to natively work with ecommerce. They rely on bridging plugins to sync product catalogs between WooCommerce and their own catalog management systems. FooSales on the other hand is an ecommerce first platform. FooSales POS connects directly to WooCommerce and uses it as a central database. This means you won’t have any syncing issues and your data is always secure and up to date, no matter how many stores or devices you connect.

= Can I run the FooSales POS web app on my own domain? =

Yes you can but you will need to purchase the [FooSales for WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/products/foosales-for-woocommerce/) extension which is sold exclusively on the WooCommerce Marketplace.


= Do you charge for technical support? =

Support is free, however, the only support channel that we currently offer is via email. Our support team is distributed across a few different time zones and we only communicate in English at present.

= How safe and private is my data? =

FooSales POS is ultra-secure since it does not store any of your store data on our servers. All of your data remains on your own website, tablet or computer. FooSales POS simply connects to your website, pulls your product catalog, and sends new orders back to your site. FooSales POS also complies with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for added peace of mind.

= How long does the FooSales POS setup process take? =

Setup only takes a minute. Install the FooSales POS plugin, link your websites URL to a FooSales account and start selling.

We recommend visiting the [Get Started](https://help.foosales.com/docs/topics/getting-started/) page which will guide you through the entire setup process.

= Can I run FooSales POS on any computer? =

Yes! The FooSales POS web app runs in most modern web browsers including Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

= How difficult is it to setup FooSales POS as I'm not very technical? =

The FooSales POS setup process is very easy. The most technical part is installing the FooSales POS WordPress plugin and connecting your WooCommerce store to FooSales POS. The FooSales POS WordPress plugin can be installed directly from your WordPress admin area by selecting 'Add New' in the Plugins menu and then search for FooSales POS. You can also download and install the plugin manually if you prefer.

We recommend visiting the [Get Started](https://help.foosales.com/docs/topics/getting-started/) page which will guide you through the entire setup process.

An active FooSales plan gives you access to FooSales POS on all platforms for the same price (web, iPad & Android tablet).

Please see our [Pricing](https://www.foosales.com/pricing/) page for current plans and pricing information.

= Can I use FooSales POS to manage multiple WooCommerce websites? =

Yes, we have a separate [FooSales Privacy Policy](https://www.foosales.com/privacy-policy/) and [FooSales Plugin Privacy Policy](https://www.foosales.com/foosales-plugin-privacy-policy/)

= Does FooSales POS store my data or transmit it to any third-parties? =

FooSales POS connects directly to your WooCommerce database using our secure REST API which fetches your store data (customers, products and orders). None of this information is saved or passed on to any third-party servers, including our own.

WooCommerce handles all the ecommerce functionality and payment processing in exactly the same way as your online store. The only customer data that we store on our side is related to your actual FooSales POS account and billing details (i.e. name, billing address, website store URL, email address and password).

FooSales POS complies with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for added peace of mind.
